Hi! I'm @Jimmyu2foru18, 
I am dedicated to advancing my knowledge and skills by pursuing a master's degree in Data Science.

As part of my ongoing educational study, 
I am honing my expertise in SQL and mastering database management skills. 
This hands-on experience forms the foundation of my commitment to becoming a data professional.

Please feel free to contact me through comments on projects and repositories.
Alternatively, you can also reach out to me by email at jimmymcguigan18@gmail.com. 
I am always excited about the prospect of collaboration and look forward to exploring the vast possibilities.
